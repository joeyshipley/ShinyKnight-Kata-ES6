# ShinyKnight Kata in ES6

Converted from the ruby roboticon talk: https://github.com/joeyshipley/Roboticon_2016_ImprovingCodeThroughReadability

This kata was designed to give you a playground to explore readability in programming. The first time you look at this consider how long it takes you to understand what it is doing. Afterwards ask yourself what parts you liked and what parts confused you. As you go through the exercise, try to notice the times you found something that surprised you.

### Reading Materials

Here are some great resources on the subject of code structure that directly relates to readability

- Read: Clean Code - Uncle Bob
- Watch: Cleancoders.com: videos 1 to 5 - Uncle Bob (Full Disclosure: his videos are light hearted and a bit odd at times, but worth their weight in gold.)
- Read: Good naming is a process, not a single step - Arlo Belshee
- Read: Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code - Martin Fowler
